      <p class="pl25px pr25px pt5px pb5px">
        After speaking with staff in Cru about different equipment needed for sound,
        media, band and other such things, I have decided that a centralized area for
        organizing wishlists for different departments of Cru would be very beneficial.
      </p>
      <p class="pl25px pr25px pt15px">
        While thinking about ways I could do this, I also realized that there are other
        needs that could be solved by a centralized web server. There is already a web
        app that I created that deals with <a href="https://github.com/ianbro/cru_inventory">inventory</a>
        but I thought of other things as well. This website will help to keep the tech
        team in cru organized and provide easy ways to do some different tasks.
