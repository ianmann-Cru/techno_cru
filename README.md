Provide utilities to make Cru tech team members' lives easier

# Project Vision
After speaking with staff in Cru about different equipment needed for sound,
media, band and other such things, I have decided that a centralized area for
organizing wishlists for different departments of Cru would be very beneficial.

While thinking about ways I could do this, I also realized that there are other
needs that could be solved by a centralized web server. There is already a web
app that I created that deals with inventory (https://github.com/ianbro/cru_inventory)
but I thought of other things as well. This website will help to keep the tech
team in cru organized and provide easy ways to do some different tasks.
